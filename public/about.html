<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am Elijem Timothy Jaso. I am a student in BS Computer Science, studying in the Ateneo de Manila University.
  I want to be a Web Developer after I graduate, but I took Data Science as my specialization so that I won't be limited to
  only Web Develpment.
</p>

<p>I am currently enrolled in a Udemy class "Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu. I am really enjoying the course,
  and I've learned a lot from my short time learning it. I hope that by the end of this course, I will be knowledgable in Web Development
  and accomplish several quality websites. I haven't really learned much about Web Development before this course except for our tidbits of
  HTML during our CSCI 40, but that was it. That's why I started from scratch in learning Web Development. I am excited what this journey of
  learning will bring me.

<p>I love my girlfriend, Keana Louisa P. Galan<3.</p>
